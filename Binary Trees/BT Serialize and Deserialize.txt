//serialize and deserialize the given bt

SERIALIZATION:

This refers to storing the the contents of 
the bt into a file.

CASES:

1: BT is a BST

What if the bt is a bst in that case use either
of the 3 traversals ie. preorder, inorder or
postorder to store the bt in the file.

Code:

void serialize(node* root,FILE *fp) {

	if(root==NULL)
		return;
		
	serialize(root->left,fp);
	fprintf(fp, "%d ", root->val);
	serialize(root->right,fp);
	return;
}

2: BT is a Complete BT

What if the BT is a complete BT. In that case
storing the level order traversal is enough as 
we know all level except the last will be
completely filled and the last will as left as
possible meaning with the level order traversal
the bt can be identified.

Code:

void serialize(node* root,FILE *fp) {

	if(root==NULL)
		return;
	
	queue<node*>q;
	q.push(root);
	while(!q.empty())
	{
		node* curr=q.front();
		q.pop();
		
		fprintf(fp, "%d ", curr->val);
		
		if(curr->left)
			q.push(curr->left);
		if(curr->right)
			q.push(curr->right);
	}
	return;
}

3: BT is a Full BT

What if the BT is a full BT. In that case simply 
storing the preorder traversal of the bt along 
with a bit telling whether the node is a leaf
or not is enough.

Code: 

void serialize(node* root,FILE *fp) {

	if(root==NULL)
		return;
	
	//storing 0 with a node value if leaf node and 1 for internal node
	fprintf(fp, "%d ", root->val);
	if(root->left==NULL && root->right==NULL)	
		fprintf(fp, "%d ", 0);
	else
		fprintf(fp, "%d ", 1);
	
	serialize(root->left,fp);
	serialize(root->right,fp);
	return;
}

4: Normal BT

What if the bt is a normal one having none
of the above properties. In that case we
have two cases:

a: storing the preorder and inorder traversals
which will require twice the space of the bt.

b: storing the preorder traversal with a marker
for NULL nodes which can be used to construct
the bt again. This will take 2*n keys but it 
is still better than those cases when the keys
have big items associated with them.

We can optimize the approach by using an extra
bit with every node which would determine whether
its internal or external, this way we dont have
to store two markers for a leaf node and as the 
number of leaf nodes are more than the internal 
nodes thus it makes sense.

Code: 

void serialize(node* root, FILE *fp) {

	if(root==NULL)
	{
		fprintf(fp, "-1 ");
		return;
	}
	
	fprintf(fp, "%d ", root->val);
	serialize(root->left,fp);
	serialize(root->right,fp);
	return;
}


DESERIALIZATION-

This refers to the process of reading the contents
of the file and then using them to form a new bt.

void deserialize(node *&root, FILE *fp) {

	int val;
	if( !fscanf(fp, "%d ", &val) || val==-1)
		return;
	
	root = newNode(val);
	deserialize(root->left,fp);
	deserialize(root->right,fp);
	return;
}
